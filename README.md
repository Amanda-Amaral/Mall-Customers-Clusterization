# Mall-Customers-Clusterization
Overview
This project demonstrates a simple clustering analysis on the Mall Customer Segmentation Data using the K-Means algorithm. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Mall Customer Segmentation Data" from Kaggle. It contains information about customers, including:

CustomerID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)

##Project Steps
###Environment Setup

Ensure Python is installed.
Install the necessary libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
bash

Copiar c√≥digo
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Download the Dataset

###Download the dataset from Kaggle and unzip it to your working directory.
###Run the Script

Use the provided Python script to perform data loading, exploration, visualization, clustering, and evaluation.

##Conclusion
This project provides a quick and simple example of clustering using the K-Means algorithm on the Mall Customer Segmentation Data. By following the steps outlined above, you can replicate the analysis and gain insights into customer segmentation.
